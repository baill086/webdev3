# Web Development - Lesson 3
### GeoJSON

## Resources
* [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html)
* [GeoJSON documentation](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html)
* [Chrome DevTools documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/)

## Task
This time the code is (mostly) all there for you already.
However, some coder rushed through their work and pushed up code containing errors!!:confounded:
So your first task will be debugging the existing code so that the application can run smoothly once again.

After you have the app up and running, there is one `FIXME` in code. Follow instructions there to complete this task.

## Deliverable
After you are done:
 * Post a link to your forked repository on Canvas.
